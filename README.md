If you want to compile this application, open up the piano2.unity file in the FinalProduct/Assets directory. Make sure to include piano2.unity and piano3.unity in the build path (the piano2 file contains the virtual piano and the piano3 file contains the drum kit).

Be sure to face forward when loading the application, as it calibrates the location of the instruments based on where the user's head is when the application loads. Pressing the shift key will bring up a menu to switch between the piano and drum kit.
